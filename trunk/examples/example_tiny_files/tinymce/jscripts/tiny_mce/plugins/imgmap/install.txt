How to install the plugin
=========================

1. copy files to plugins/imgmap/

2. set up your instance in the tinyMCE.init method to use the plugin, like:
plugins : "table,save,advhr,advimage,imgmap,...",

3. set up your instance to use the imgmap button, for example:
theme_advanced_buttons3_add : "emotions,iespell,...,imgmap",

4. you might need to add:
extended_valid_elements : "img[usemap|class|src|border=0|alt|title|hspace|vspace|width|height|align|onmouseover|onmouseout|name],map[id|name],area[shape|alt|coords|href|target]",

Notes:
* You may only add extra buttons to your tiny instance if you are using the advanced theme
* The plugin only works with tiny version 2.x
* In some cases TinyMCE includes editor_plugin_src.js instead of editor_plugin.js. Since this file was not part
  of some earlier versions, you can simply copy editor_plugin.js as editor_plugin_src.js in your plugin directory.
