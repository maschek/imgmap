= Introduction =

MediaWiki by default comes with a wiki text editor, and no image map support.
Once you install the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ImageMap wiki imagemap plugin], you will be able to add image maps, however editing these will require lot of manual work.
You can have a visual image map editor, if you also install the [http://mediawiki.fckeditor.net/index.php/FCKeditor_integration_guide FCKeditor extension] along with imgmap plugin, and tweak it a bit to play nicely with imgmap extension and mediawiki. Read on for the steps required.

= Installing ImageMap wiki extension =

Read the instructions carefully here:
http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ImageMap
Once you installed, test the extension.


= Installing FCKEditor =

Read the instructions here:
http://mediawiki.fckeditor.net/index.php/FCKeditor_integration_guide
Once installed, test your new editor.

= Installing imgmap plugin for FCKEditor =

  # Put the imgmap plugin at place, general instructions at [FCKEditor_setup], the only difference is that:
   * You have to copy the plugin to the {yourwiki}/extensions/FCKeditor/plugins/imgmap directory
   * You have to edit {yourwiki}/extensions/FCKeditor/fckeditor_config.js to add the plugin and to add the toolbar button
  # Clear your browser cache, and try your editor.

MORE EDIT COMES

= Notes =
  # Once you have set up FCK, you will have to patch it, otherwise it will not accept <imagemap> tags. Patch and details can be found [http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2432 here]. This is not a stable and approved patch, so use it at your own will.
  # To allow imagemap tags, edit your LocalSettings.php and add:
{{{
$RTEprotectedTags[ 'imagemap' ] = array(
    'protect' => true,

);
}}}
