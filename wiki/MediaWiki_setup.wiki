= Introduction =

MediaWiki by default comes with a wiki text editor, but can be extended to use FCKEditor or TinyMCE. To be able to use imagemaps, you will also need the [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ImageMap wiki imagemap plugin].


= Using FCKEditor =

  # To set up FCK, follow the instructions carefully in the [http://mediawiki.fckeditor.net/index.php/FCKeditor_integration_guide FCKeditor integration guide]
  # Once you have set up FCK, you will have to patch it, otherwise it will not accept <imagemap> tags. Patch and details can be found [http://dev.fckeditor.net/ticket/2432 here]. This is not a stable and approved patch, so use it at your own will.
  # To allow imagemap tags, edit your LocalSettings.php and add:
{{{
$RTEprotectedTags[ 'imagemap' ] = array(
    'protect' => true,

);
}}}
  # Once done, you can put the imgmap plugin at place, general instructions at [FCKEditor_setup], the only difference is that:
   * You have to copy the plugin to the {yourwiki}/extensions/FCKeditor/plugins/imgmap directory
   * You have to edit {yourwiki}/extensions/FCKeditor/fckeditor_config.js to add the plugin and to add the toolbar button
  # Finally you can [http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Extension:ImageMap set up the Imagemap extension]
  # Clear your browser cache, and try your editor.
